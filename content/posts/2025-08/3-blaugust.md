I saw bunch of my blogger friends posting about [Blaugust](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/?utm_source=blog.douchi.space). At first I wasn't planing to participate, as I'm not used to external motivation for blogging, and majority of my blogs are in Chinese (even though there's an [English]({{< relref "/categories/English/" >}}) category there are only 8 blogs in English, mostly career related content which was not my favorite thing to write about).

Tonight I opened my laptop to write my diary before going to bed and saw yet another blogger friend [Allison](https://thewanderingallison.vercel.app/posts/diary20250807/?utm_source=blog.douchi.space) posting about it. Since I'm already writing something everyday, why not participate and have the chance to let more blogger friends learn about it, and maybe even motivate them to write more? So here we go.

I'm most likely still gonna post in Chinese, though figure it might be nice to have a brief intro post in English for starter. Not sure what prompts there would be so I may not follow, and I'm not aiming for the Rainbow Diamond Award of posting everyday either.

## Who am I?
{{< wrap "https://douchi.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/dino_statict.png" "" l >}}

I'm 椒盐豆豉 (she/her) or Mt. Front. I'm a blogger, podcaster, pixel art learner, beginner runner, causual birder, hobby collector and software engineer.

I started writing blogs 20 years ago when the first wave of blog boom came to China (when I was in middle school). Throughout the years the platforms I wrote on went bankrupt, or became too censored or misogynistic. As many fellow Chinese, I became an internet exile, wandering around different content/social platforms. Eventually [I started this blog of my own]({{< relref "/posts/2023-archive/2020-10-29-hello-world-its-me-again" >}}).

I'm currently located in Seattle, USA, working remotely as a software engineer. Throughout my career I've worked for big tech, small startup and unicorn company. I'd say software engineer is merely a day job that puts food on my table. Programming or progressing in career ladder are never my passion. I dream about retiring from this career everyday, though as a day job it pays well, isn't too stressful and is flexible enough to let me work remotely. So I stick to it, for now.

## So... what do I mean by hobby collector?
I like to collect hobbies. I espeicially enjoy trying new things and writing blogs about them. A lot of my blogs are actually [product reviews]({{< relref "/tags/消费主义陷阱/" >}}). And of course, 'things' also include experiences, include but not limited to [traveling]({{< relref "/tags/travel" >}}), [wellness]({{< relref "/tags/wellness/" >}}), side hustle and other random stuff.

One of my proudest hobbies I picked up is [pixel art]({{< relref "/tags/pixelart/" >}}). I did a [100-day project]({{< relref "/posts/2023-archive/2020-08-09-100-days-of-pixel-art" >}}) and have been kept drawing every now and then in past 5 years. For example I draw my current profile pic: {{< emoji "http://localhost:1313/public/dino.gif" >}}

One recent hobby I picked up is running, or jogging to be more precise. I hated running for past 30+ years of my life, but this time I succeeded in sticking to the routine, maybe because I was too weak as a child but has improved my cardio after years of swimming, hiking and weight lifting. I've been running 4-5 times every week in the past year. Here's a site I built (on top of an open source project) to [track my steps (running, walking, hiking, etc)](https://steps.douchi.space?utm_source=blog)

My newest hobby is boxing. I hate contact/competitive sports though, and I wear high prescription glasses, so I only do bag boxing for now and love it. Back and shoulder muscle are probably the ones I wanted to build the most so that works great.

My oldest hobbies are probably watching movies, reading and video games. I can't endure classic movies though, also not the biggest fan of art films, so won't brag about my tastes. I have been counting 2000+ movies and tv series and written short reviews about them. Here's some of my favorites:
- Movie: *Marriage Story*, *Mad Max: Fury Road*, *Zootopia* (hard time debating bewteen *The Lion King* as my all time favorite animation film), *Coherence* and *The Last Duel*
- Book: *Maybe You Should Talk To Someone*, *How We Got to Now*, *Egypt, Greece, & Rome*, *The Ancestor's Tale* and *Shark's Fin and Sichuan Pepper*.
- Game: *The Witcher 3*, *Assassin's Creed II* (I have a tatto of its logo!), *Dead Cells*, *It Takes Two*, *Dave the Diver*

Hobbies that I wish I have more time or space to do:
- Lego
- Swimming
- Wood carving
- Pixel art
- Road trip
- Gaming

## What else do I create besides blog?
Most of the following content are in Chinese:

- I run a [Mastodon instance](https://douchi.space). Started almost the same time as this blog. 
- I make [podcasts]({{< relref "tags/podcast/" >}}). My newest one *Other than Default* is a career podcast, where I talk to people in tech industry that does not fit into the "tech bro" stereotype. I don't enjoy my career, but I hate letting tech pro mis-represent the people in it more.
- I have a [telegram channel](https://t.me/mtfront) where I post random stuff I find interesting or useful.
- My movies, books and games are synced to my [notion database](https://mtfront.notion.site/2485c762efe040b988531aaa3e45ad25?source=copy_link)
- I also have a notion database for [product reviews & referrals](https://mtfront.notion.site/mtfront-shopping-reviews-e568ee6ebaa44b5da146cbe4ac4663eb?source=copy_link). Haven't updated this one for a while though because I also write [newsletter]({{< relref "/tags/关我辟事/" >}}) about my life & product review updates so I got too lazy to update in both places.
- Last but not least I have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=46962965) and [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/S6S130C16) for people who use my mastodon instance or enjoy my content to show support. People can also subscribe to have coffee chat with me or commision pixel art. It's way below market rate but I used to provide free coffee chat, however after it's been abused a few times I lost patience. So it's more of a small gate keeper instead of income source.

I said 'brief intro' but here we are 6000 words and 1 hour later... Drop a comment w/ your blog if you're a bloger & hobby collector too! I enjoy reading people's blog about life. Happy blogging!
