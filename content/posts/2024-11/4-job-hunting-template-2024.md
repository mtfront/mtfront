# [Job hunting template 2024](https://mtfront.notion.site/Job-hunting-template-2024-13a546f5e72680e08dbff3c75518f5f5?pvs=4)

This is a job hunting tracking board I built when hunting for a software engineer job in 2024 in the US (if you read Chinese, here’s my [blog post]({{< relref "/posts/2024-09/5-job-hunting-2024">}}/?utm_source=job_template_blog) about it). 

The tags and status might be tuned towards software engineer interview process, but feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

Detailed instruction is listed in the template.

- It’s way below market rate because I don’t depend on this to make money and want to provide help for those who in need.
- However when I provided it for free in the past I’ve encountered people who abused it and wasted my time. Thus the gate keeping price.
