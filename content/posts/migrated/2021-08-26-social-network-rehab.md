I got a little bit upset last Sunday for no good reason, so I decided to take a break from all my social network for 3 days and see what happens.

<!--more-->

### Why am I doing it {.wp-block-heading}

There&#8217;s no correlation indicated by this &#8220;so&#8221; &#8212; I didn&#8217;t get triggered by something on the social network (benefit of dumping censored like shit social network hosted in mainland China like Douban). I don&#8217;t know why I suddenly came to the conclusion of I should get away from social network that day, but I did it anyways.

I guess the underlying force that&#8217;s driving me to do it could be fear of starting a new job after not been working for 7 months. Yes I&#8217;m starting a new job, and yes I haven&#8217;t been working since mid January this year. That&#8217;s another long story (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.douchi.space/?p=1640" data-type="post" data-id="1640" target="_blank">if you read Chinese you can check it out here</a>).

In the past 7 months I&#8217;ve spent most of my time doing following things if I&#8217;m not sleeping, hiking, working out, reading, watching Netflix or traveling and meeting friends offline:

  * Scrolling and posting to my mastodon (a decentralized twitter-like social network, I host my own instance which is connected to many others&#8217;)
  * Chatting with my new friends I met on discord, on discord
  * Connecting with my real life friends (and sometimes online friends) on Instagram
  * Occasionally checking twitter for artists and friends from tech world

Sometimes these things ate up more than 50% of the time I&#8217;m awake. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a bad thing. Actually I probably got to connect to more people than I&#8217;ve done in the past 5 years combined and I&#8217;m really happy about it (even I&#8217;m usually a bit anti-social) and surprised that I did it. Probably because work is not using up all my energy.

But, as I&#8217;m restarting my professional life after a while, such life style would definitely NOT be sustainable. 

I&#8217;m pretty good at executing things that I actually want to do. Yes, I procrastinate A LOT, on small things like getting up, taking shower, finishing a meal, putting my phone down, and very often, on work I don&#8217;t want to do. But for things I DO want to do, I execute them hard and at full speed:

  * I didn&#8217;t touch my computer for 6 months when I was preparing for Gaokao (a much harder version of SAT to get into college in China) back in the era of no smartphone. 
  * I have studied for GRE (the test you need to take to apply for most of US graduate schools) for a few months more than 8 hours every day, while I have full time college classes to attend. 
  * I have learned <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.douchi.space/?p=482" data-type="post" data-id="482" target="_blank">Pixel Art for 100 days non stop</a>, probably 1 &#8211; 3 hours a day, while having a full time job, no matter if I&#8217;m sick or traveling or only slept 4 hours or have a tight deadline to beat. 
  * I have lost 10% of my weight in 3 months without spending extra time on diet or exercising, just by hard starting a 20/4 intermittent fasting (IF) without any IF experience.
  * You got the idea.

So, even I&#8217;ve been a heavy social network user back when social network wasn&#8217;t a thing (the good old days of blog and bbs), a 3-day social network rehab was merely a challenge for me.

I use the word rehab instead of a more common word &#8220;detoxic&#8221; because nothing is intoxicating me on my social network (although &#8220;rehab&#8221; probably make it sound like a worse problem). It&#8217;s just me want to reshape a long time habit to better adapt to a lifestyle change.

### What I did {.wp-block-heading}

Following things were crossed off my list for 3 days:

  * Personal Discord (discord for work is another story)
  * Mastodon (so, the only Chinese social network platform I&#8217;m still actively on)
  * Instagram
  * Forums, twitter, reddit, etc
  * Douban (I had been only updating watching, reading, playing libraries and not using it for social purpose for a while anyways. Now it&#8217;s just stop checking notification or occasionally replying) 

What I still left on:

  * DMs (I&#8217;m not disappearing or isolating myself in any means)
  * 3 Wechat group chat (The only active ones I have is a 3 close group and 2 college friends ones)
  * Youtube (I usually just queue up videos to watching during workout and hadn&#8217;t have spending a ton of time on it anyways)
  * Telegram channel (I post fun things I read or watched to my own channel occasionally, and I read a few tech and gaming news channel)

With the good several hours spared from social network everyday, what I did more were:

  * Work, probably just because it&#8217;s still new, but I&#8217;ve never felt so productive, shipped my first PR to production on day 3.
  * Newsletter and blog reading, mostly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/r?kid=aa5ac021" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/r?kid=aa5ac021" target="_blank">Morning Brew</a>, my rss feed, google news, sspai (a Chinese tech review platform)
  * Random errands that&#8217;s been sitting on my todo list for a while 

I also started (again) a daily focus list to list and cross off important achievements of a day. I&#8217;ve tried this multiple times, on physical paper, on hand-writing e-ink tablet, using digital todo list. Non of those attempts succeeded in either boosting my productivity or making me feel good. 

This time I use Notion toggle + checkbox (also explored using Database as I do for most of other cases but didn&#8217;t work, as the additional clicking into an entry adds friction). So far it&#8217;s feeling strong and will see if it last.

### What I learned {.wp-block-heading}

As you can see I spend more paragraphs on &#8220;why&#8221; than &#8220;what&#8221;, because &#8220;what&#8221; in this case is fundamentally very simple and anyone can do it, if they want. But looking back and analyzing &#8220;why&#8221; is what makes me &#8220;want&#8221; to do it, like really want, not just &#8220;yeah maybe some day&#8221; want.

So takeaways:

#### When completely taking something off my list, I don&#8217;t FOMO.  {.wp-block-heading}

To be honest I don&#8217;t FOMO (fear of missing out) for most of things anyways. I ate alone at school. I say no to most of company parties. I ignored and will be ignoring bitcoin, NFT and GME without regret. But for social network, there&#8217;s an urge to check every few minutes to see if there&#8217;s new reply or like. When I decided to completely not touching it, the urge is gone.

#### I want to share {.wp-block-heading}

I still have a lot of things I want to share. Including but not limited to: new discord features I learned, a productive conversion with CEO, a colleague that looks like a friend, my cats cuddling, a deal I found relevant to certain group of people, my random thoughts, etc. Halfway through this rehab I started to want to write this blog. Without social network a lot of those things have no outlet. I can triage some of them to real life and channels I still left on, but those are not sufficient or appropriate for every case.

#### Solution? {.wp-block-heading}

So now I&#8217;m considering timeboxing my social network usage. In those dedicated slots I&#8217;ll scroll my feed and sending likes without guilt. Outside of those box if I have something to say, post it, but don&#8217;t check feed or notification. 

Not sure if it will work but worth a try.

原谅我用中文写评论  
如果你一开始就是只决定离开 SNS 三天，这会不会是你没有 HOMO 感觉的原因？（抱歉擅自揣度您的想法）如果是离开一个月、更久，或者完全离开，我觉得很多人是会有与现代社会脱节的担忧的，这大概是 SNS 的戒断反应之一。  
另外值得说明的一点是，如果是像我这样很少有现实社交的人，离开了网络，是需要有转移这部分社交需求的渠道的，不然很容易陷入到自我封闭里去。

*HOMO -> FOMO  
抱歉，虚拟主播看多了。

我是决定了不关心的事情就很少 FOMO 啦，就像我决定长时间离开知乎离开豆瓣也没有在 FOMO。所以如果将来真的有一天我决定离开所有社交网络的话的，那多半是我 made informed decision of this doesn&#8217;t matter to me, which indicates that 我的需求在其他地方得到满足。如果不能的话，那为什么要做这种决定呢？另外，就算决定了还是可以改回来嘛，何必自己为难自己。

哈哈哈从来没有FOMO感但非常有分享欲+1  
即使我几乎不刷朋友圈，微信号还能用的时候我还是会发朋友圈。然后发现什么好玩的或者有意义的事情就想在豆瓣/长毛象写出来让大家看到。

让我戒掉这种特别爱说的习惯好像太难受了点，所以其实需要克制的可能是发了东西要不停check回复从而浪费的时间？

### Comment by 椒盐豆豉 on 2021-08-26 23:36:32 -0700
我也是发了东西不停 check！感觉需要写个 bot 把自己要发的东西 queue 了然后不直接打开有回复的平台 ←_←

可能与我做决定的方式有关。  
我在 <a href="https://misskey.io/notes/8pc20ih55a" rel="nofollow ugc">https://misskey.io/notes/8pc20ih55a</a> 有说，“知道什么东西是该放弃掉” 是重要的。  
意味着一样东西就算存在好处，在权衡其缺点，我的时间，产生的价值等因素之后，如果不值得，那就放弃，就算它存在好处。  
但主观就是主观，不会管这些功利性的东西，加上原先已经习惯了这些东西，在某些时刻产生的“失去”的感觉更加强烈，就是 FOMO 了

抱歉，我的论述可能有点混乱和文不对题，尽力补充一下。  
重新总结一下。“决定了不关心的事情就很少 FOMO ”，我做不到，可能我的理性和感性隔离得有点开，互相之间的影响力比较弱。  
“需求在其他地方得到满足“，除了是我判断这是刚性需求以外，我不会在完全得到这样的结论时才会行动，原因论述见前文。  
（上条评论我邮箱又写错了，贵博客不考虑一下加删除评论或者修改的功能吗）
